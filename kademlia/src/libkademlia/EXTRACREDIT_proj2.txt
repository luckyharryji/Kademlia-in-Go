New test created for Project 2:

- TestIterativeFindNode:
    Create kNum Kademlia and use connect function let them to ping each other. In this way each node will have some information about other node. We select one node to be target node and then call iterativefindnode. Then we check whether the result equals the target node.

- TestIterativeStore:
    Create kNum Kademlia and use connect function let them to ping each other. In this way each node will have some information about other node. We call iterativeStore. Then we check whether the value is stored in each contact returned by iterativeStore.

- TestIterativeFindValue:
    Create kNum Kademlia and use connect function let them to ping each other. In this way each node will have some information about other node. We select one node to be target node and then call store value to it. Then we use the NodeID of the target node as key to call iterativeFindValue. And then check whether we can find the value or not. If we can find the value, then we store the value to the node which is closet to the key. If we cannot find the value, we return an error that contains the key searched for and ID of the closest node you were able to find.
